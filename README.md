1.     Title Page  
What it needs: Game Name – Perhaps also add a subtitle (Anything in blue is NOT REQUIRED) 	Star Wars Run

2.     Game Overview
What it needs: ?  Game Concept: (quick overview of the game) This game is where you are a star wars character and you are running through different parts of the galaxy trying to survive. As you pass a level it gets harder. And ever 2 levels the planet and part of the galaxy you are on changes.  You are constantly jumping over broken ships going through caves and going under rocks and other stuff. You start with the generic stormtrooper and as you collect coins you can get new characters the best one being Rey (because she is my favorite). You can buy powerups before the game like a lightsaber and other things. You get 2 hearts for the generic stormtrooper but if you have a powerful character you get more. You lose a heart if you run into something. You die if a stormtrooper catches you.

3.     Gameplay and  Mechanics
What it needs:		Gameplay
Game Progression: How does the game go on? (example… get to the end of the level) To get to the end of the level you have to survive running through the planet. There could be stormtrooper going after you a ship could crash and you have to dodge it. (I am still figuring out more).
Mission/challenge Structure (what is challenging about the game) The game is challenging because you have a lot of challenges you have to face before you are able to run to the finish line and go on. As I said before you have to jump things like droids and anytime you could be being chased by a stormtrooper.
Objectives – What are the objectives of the game? How does it work? (do you have money involved? Are there levels to get through? etc.) It has money and levels. You get money while running through the planet. It will just be on the track and you have to run and collect it. There are many levels. Every level it gets harder. And every 2 levels you move to a different place in the galaxy.

4.     The story, Setting, and Character 
Story and Narrative – what is the story behind your game?
The story is trying to survive through star wars. It is based on the new movies.
Play Flow – How does the game flow for the game player?
Once you beat a level you move on to the next. And then once you do them all you win.
Mechanics – What are the rules for the game. (This is the model of the universe that the game works under.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact? )
The rules are you have to run through a few of the Star Wars Planets like Jakku from the newest 3 movies. Once you finish them all you win. And all of the characters are standing there cheering.
Movement in the game? (How do players move in the game?)
You hold down a button to run and when you let go you stop. There will be separate buttons for jumps and going under.
